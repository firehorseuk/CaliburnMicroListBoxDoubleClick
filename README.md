CaliburnMicro ListBox DoubleClick Example

This solves the perennial problem WPF MVVM ListBox double click problem along with using the CaliburnMicro framework.

There is no code-behind.

Example is taken from https://www.programmersedge.com/caliburnmicro-wpf-double-click-event/

Its a wordpress site and the images and file download do not link to anything so I've re-created the example and put it up on Github in case the original example ever disappears.
